## Overview

The independent set problem is a fundamental graph problem with a wide range of applications. Given a graph $$G = (V, E)$$, a set of vertices $$M \subset V$$ is independent if no two vertices in $$M$$ are adjacent in $$G$$. A maximal independent set (**MIS**) is an independent set that
is not a proper subset of any other independent set. A maximum independent set (**Max-IS**) is a maximum cardinality independent set. While Max-IS is one of Karp’s 21 classic NP-complete problems, computing a MIS can easily be done by a simple greedy algorithm in
$$O(|E|)$$ time. The **MIS** problem has been studied in the context of several other prominent
problems, e.g., graph coloring, maximum matching, and vertex cover. On the
other hand, Max-IS serves as a natural model for many real-life optimization problems,
including map labeling, computer vision, information retrieval, and scheduling.


This is the open source project DynaMIS---a dynamic maximum independent solver developed at the  Institute of Logic and Computation, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria.
So far our framework contains a deterministic algorithm for maintaining a **MIS** (and thus a $$4$$-approximate **Max-IS**) of a dynamic set of uniform rectangles with amortized sub-logarithmic update time. This breaks the natural barrier of $$\Omega(\Delta)$$ update time, where $$\Delta$$ is the maximum degree in the graph. We also provide a series of deterministic dynamic approximation schemes for maintaining a **Max-IS**. The algorithm **GRID** maintains a $$4$$-approximate **Max-IS** with $$O(1)$$ update time. Its derived algorithm **GRID-K** establishes the trade-off between approximation quality $$2(1+\frac{1}{k})$$ and update time  $$O(k^2\log n)$$. Our framework also includes an algorithm that maintains unit interval graphs. With this algorithm,  a $$2$$-approximate **Max-IS** for dynamic sets of unit-height rectangles with $$O(\omega \log n)$$ update time can be maintained, where $$\omega$$ is the maximum size of an independent set of the rectangles stabbed by any horizontal line.
